    "1. As of 9/28/2018 4:36 p.m. CNN news received the lowest compound score, which means that people who hastag CNN are generally expressing negative emotions towards CNN's post. Perhaps due to chance, but the latest post made by CNN was on America's national parks being dry up and warm, which could lead to concerns and frustration of environmentalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Majority of the tweets remain neutral while there are few tweets scattered in positive or negative public sentiment. There's no particular sign which media source receive more negativ or positive public sentiments. The reason is probably due to the many different types of news covered by each media sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Another interesting fact worth mentioning is that public sentiment of each media source changes as I'm working on the project. It explains that public reaction to the articles covered changes based on the type of news covered more rather than the media source itself. If public sentiment ties with the media source itself, then the compound score should not have changed drastically when new posts are made. However, since this project only covers the last 100 posts, the research is very recent. To find out public's feeling toward a specific media source, we should conduct a research based larger number of tweets. "
